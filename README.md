# Curtis Bohlen Github Archive

# Contents of This Archive

The repositories included in this archive include several "side projects"
undertaken as part of my work for the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership, as
well as a few small personal coding projects.  Archive contents  are
written principally in R and Python.

The primary purpose of this archive is for sharing examples of data
analysis code, documenting past data analysis, and minimizing
risk of reinventing wheels in the future. Most projects here are informal,
one-off efforts. For the most part, repositories are not in active
development and I do not check for comments, questions or pull requests.

### State of Casco Bay Data Archives

The 2021 "State of Casco Bay" data and data analysis archives have been moved
to their permanent homes. Working data, with streamlined versions of data
analysis can be found at [CBEP-SoCB](https://github.com/CBEP-SoCB). Complete
archives, including original data, code for data QA/QC and data preparation, 
and many other details, can be found at 
[CBEP-SoCB-Details](https://github.com/CBEP-SoCB-Details).

Working directories for data analysis supporting the 2026 State of Casco Bay
report are available at [SoCB-2026](https://github.com/SoCB-2026).

## Context and Background

I am currently Executive Director for the Casco Bay
Estuary Partnership, in Portland, Maine.

I have a background working with nonprofits, in academia, and
in the private sector on a variety of environmental and water-related
topics, usually on the boundary between science and policy.  Recent work
includes studies of coastal water quality, wetland restoration, impact
of climate change on coastal wetlands, and coastal acidification.

I have managed three successive "State of Casco Bay" reports (2010,
2015, and the "sixth edition", released in 2021). Data and analysis code
for the sixth edition are available at the links provided above. The reports
themselves are available via the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership
[website](cascobayestuary.org).

As part of my work for the Partnership, I sometimes provide statistical
analysis or experimental design assistance to organizations with whom we
work. Several of the repositories included here were derived from those side
projects.
