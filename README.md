# Curtis Bohlen Github Archive

# Contents of This Archive
The repositories included in this archive include several "side projects"
undertaken as part of my work for the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership, as 
well as a few small personal coding projects.  Archive contents  are 
written principally in R and Python.

The primary purpose of this archive is for sharing examples of data 
analysis code, documenting past data analysis, and minimizing
risk of reinventing wheels in the future.  Most projects here are informal,
one-off efforts. For the most part, repositories are not in active 
development and I do not check for comments, questions or pull requests.

### State of Casco Bay Data Archives
The "State of Casco Bay" data and data analysis archives have been moved 
to more permanent homes.  Working data, with streamlined versions of data 
analysis can be found at [CBEP-SoCB](https://github.com/CBEP-SoCB). Complete 
archives, including original data, code for data QA/QC and data preparation, 
and many other details, can be found at
[CBEP-SoCB-Details](https://github.com/CBEP-SoCB-Details). 

## Context and Background
I am currently Executive Director, and Staff Scientist for the Casco Bay 
Estuary Partnership, in Portland, Maine. 

I have a background working with nonprofits, in academia, and
in the private sector on a variety of environmental and water-related
topics, usually on the boundary between science and policy.  Recent work
 includes studies of coastal water quality, wetland restoration, impact 
of climate change on coastal wetlands, and coastal acidification.

I have managed three successive "State of Casco Bay" reports (2010, 
2015, and the "sixth edition", released in 2021).  Data and analysis code
for the sixth edition are available at the links provided above. The reports 
themselves are available via the Casco Bay Estaury Partnership 
[website](cascobayestuary.org).

As part of my work for the Partnership, I sometimes provide statistical 
analysis or experimental design assistance to organizations with whom we 
work. Several of the repositories included here were derived from those side 
projects.
